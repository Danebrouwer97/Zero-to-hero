# A Brief Practical introduction to Firebase
## Zero-To-Hero: an Angular based Project
## Requirements:
1. Node
    * To check this, you can run the following command:
        * `node -v`
        * This should return a version
        * e.g. `v12.14.0`
    * [I Need help installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Firebase CLI
    * To check this, you can run the following command:
        * `firebase --version`
        * This should return a version
        * e.g. `8.10.0`
    * [I Need help installing Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli#windows-npm)
        * I would recommend installing Firebase using NPM rather than the standalone binary, it's simply easier.
3. A Google Account
    * This will be used to interact with Firebase

## Setup Steps:
1. Install the required packages using `npm`
    * You will need to run the following command:
        * `npm install` or `npm i`
12. Login to Firebase CLI using your Google Account
    * You will need to run the following command:
        * `firebase login`
